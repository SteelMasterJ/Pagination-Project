/*** 
Added 2 global variables, per instructions this can be done only using 2 variables. The first stores all the list items and the second variable stores the number of li items to be shown per page, which is 10.
***/
const studentList = document.querySelectorAll('li');
const itemsPerPage = 10;

/*** 
   Create the `showPage` function to hide all of the items in the 
   list except for the ten you want to show.

   Pro Tips: 
     - Keep in mind that with a list of 54 students, the last page 
       will only display four.
     - Remember that the first student has an index of 0.
     - Remember that a function `parameter` goes in the parens when 
       you initially define the function, and it acts as a variable 
       or a placeholder to represent the actual function `argument` 
       that will be passed into the parens later when you call or 
       "invoke" the function 
***/




/*** 
   Create the `appendPageLinks function` to generate, append, and add 
   functionality to the pagination buttons.
